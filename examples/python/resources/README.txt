FSManifestInfo Python Example Resources
========================================

This directory contains resources demonstrating data file handling
in FSManifestInfo-enabled Python applications.

The application showcases:
- Python module dependencies (local libraries)
- Third-party PyPI dependencies (numpy, click, requests, etc.)
- Data file dependencies (config and resource files)
- Proper layer separation for optimized container images

When built with FSManifestInfo, these resources are properly
categorized and can be placed in appropriate container layers.
